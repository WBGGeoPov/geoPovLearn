## Welcome {.title}

### Revolutionize Your Analysis in Stata and R

**AI Agent-Assisted Workflow with GitHub Copilot and Claude**

::: {.notes}
Welcome to the first seminar in our series on AI-assisted analysis.
:::

Speaker: **Eduard Bukin**

---

## Today's Agenda

- Example 1: From a messy code to a reproducible package

- Key Concepts:

  - AI-Chat vs AI-Agent vs Inline Code Completion

  - Context awareness

  - Model communication protocol (MCP)

  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

  - LLMs for coding: GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GTP, Anthropic Claude, and others

- How to start using AI in coding?

  - Software Setup Overview

  - Tips and Best Practices

- Example 2: Develop analysis with AI assistance

- Q&A and Discussion

---

## Motivation (1)

AI tools that we got used to over past years are impressive!

::: {.incremental}

**Traditional Chat-Based Tools:**

- Web-based [Open AI ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)

- Isolated AI models, [Google AI in search](https://search.google/ai-in-search/)

- [WB MAI](https://ai.worldbank.org/chat/mai)

- are extremely useful and complement eachother.

- Rely on conversational interface and manual copy-paste of code snippets.

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Integrated Approach**

- Context-aware AI Agents

- Integrated development environment (IDE)

- Project-specific assistance

## Example 1: From Messy Code to Reproducible Package {.demo}

**Live demonstration of building a reproducibility package with AI assistance**

---

## Example 1: Summary

::: {.incremental}

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Positron

- GitHub Copilot that uses Anthropic [Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM](https://claude.com/) to provide

  - Inline code completions
  - Chat: help and assistance
  - Agent: active changes to my code and code execution

-  Under 5 mins we've created a well-structured reproducibility package from messy code running both: Stata and R and creating fully customized graphics and reports.

## How does this different from traditional AI chat?

- We did not copy-paste anything from chat windows to our code.

- The AI agent was fully **aware of** our project **context**, files, data, and code.

- The AI agent was able to **autonomously execute** code, make changes to files, and create new files.

- The AI agent was **integrated** into our development environment (IDE) and worked **alongside us**.

- The AI agent **did not have access to our data** outside of our local machine and IDE.

  - All code was executed locally on our machine.

## Quick question:

### What AI tools and software do you use in your daily work so far?

- Chat-based (in browser or an app):

  - OpenAI GPT
  - Microsoft Copilot (Windows or Office/Word/Excel)
  - WB MAI (Web-based tools)
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Anthropic Claude
  - Google Gemini
  - Grok
  - Others: ___________

- Agent-integrated software:

  - Positron + GH Copilot / Other LLMs
  - VS Code + GH Copilot / Other LLMs
  - RStudio + GH Copilot / Other LLMs
  - JupyterLab + GH Copilot / Other LLMs
  - Claude Code + Anthropic LLMs
  - Cursor + LLMs
  - GitHub Copilot Workspace (web-based)
  - Others: ___________

# Key Concepts:

- AI-Chat vs AI-Agent vs Inline Code Completion
- Context awareness
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- LLMs for coding: GitHub Copilot, OpenAI GTP, Anthropic Claude, and others

---

## AI-Chat vs AI-Agent vs Inline Code Completion (1)

### AI-Chat: ask mode

- Conversational interface
- General purpose assistance
- Limited context awareness: knows only what you provide
- One‑off questions
- Code snippets
- Explanations of code/output

### Usage:

> Use Ask mode to think.

---

## AI-Chat vs AI-Agent vs Inline Code Completion (2)

### AI-Agent

- Autonomous task execution
- Full project context awareness
- Integrated with development tools
- Can read/write files, run code, and make changes (after user approval)
- Multi‑step workflows
- End‑to‑end tasks (clean → estimate → table → robustness)

### Usage:

Use Agent mode to execute explicit instructions

---

### Inline Code Completion

- Real-time code suggestions while you type could be context-aware and not

---

## Context Awareness

**What AI "knows" when helping you code:**

- **Your files**: All code files, documentation, and project structure
- **Your data structure**: Variable names, data types, and relationships (without sending raw data to cloud)
- **Your history**: Recent edits, commands run, and conversations
- **Your environment**: Installed packages, dependencies, and configurations
- **Your intent**: Current task based on files you have open and recent actions
- **Results of code execution**: Output, errors, and logs from running code

**Why it matters:**

- AI gives relevant suggestions specific to *your* project
- No need to copy-paste code context manually
- AI understands dependencies between files
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in your actual codebase

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> "... is a standardized, open framework for AI models (LLMs) to securely and efficiently connect with external applications, data sources, tools, and each-other acting like a universal adapter (e.g., USB-C for AI)" [Google search AI](https://www.google.com/search?q=model+communication+protocol) + [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)

![](images/mcp-diagram.png)

It is essential to connect AI to your software, e.g.:

- Execution environment: **Stata**, R, Python
- Editors: Positron, VS Code, RStudio, JupyterLab

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

---

## LLMs for Coding and beyond

Software development vs Data Analysis!

# How to start using AI in coding and data analysis?

- Master new software: Positron + GitHub Copilot (Anthropic Claude)
