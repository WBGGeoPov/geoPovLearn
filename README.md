## 🌍 About GeoPov

We are development economists and geospatial enthusiasts working at the intersection of poverty, place, and policy. We believe that where people live matters just as much as how they live — and we're here to make sure that spatial realities are part of the poverty dialogue.

## 📚 What's in This Repository

This repository contains materials from our:

- **Seminar Series**: Technical presentations and workshops on geospatial data and poverty analysis
- **Training Materials**: Hands-on guides and practical exercise
- **Resources**: Curated data sources and methodological guidance

## 🎯 Our Three Pillars

1. **Spatial Analysis** - Applying geographic lens to poverty and inequality questions
2. **Knowledge and Data Center** - Curated repository of geospatial data sources and methods
3. **Capacity Building** - Training and peer-learning events for microeconomists
